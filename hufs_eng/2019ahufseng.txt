By guaranteeing the access rights to public users, the Open Public Data Act has contributed to the improvement of the quality of life and the national economy. We reviewed the efforts to activate the use of the open public data and the quality management models of the open public data. At this point, we should pay attention not to the quantitative expansion but the provision of high quality open public data. We propose a few recommendations. The strategic committee should evaluate the status of usage on the open public data. The quality management model on the open public data should be expanded to fulfill the users¡¯ requirements. The assessments of quality management on the open public data should be open to more diverse professionals.
