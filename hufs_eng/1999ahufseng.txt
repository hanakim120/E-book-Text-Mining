This paper is to report a design and implementation scheme for a block management system which facilitates the management of production information flow in a large scale multi-product multi-project production environment. Products and projects are modulized into manageable sub-units(blocks) which are used as the basis for the control of production information flow in all the spectrum of production activities from the contract stage to the delivery of the final products. A block code design scheme is developed for each of products. Accompanied are a production management scheme for each stage of production activities involving drawing planning, material planning, and production planning. The block code design and production management scheme is developed for the ¡°A¡± heavy industry corporation.
