The globalization and the active response to changes in technology and customer requirements are critical for the success of QM in the 21th century. The ISO 9000: Global QMS - Requirements has reflected these changes. The ISO 9000:1987 standards implemented the system based and third party certification system, and facilitated systematic documentation of QM best practices. Through the 2000 revision, the basic principles and activities of QM - process approach, continuous improvement, customer satisfaction - were integrated into the standards. In the 2015 revision, the high level requirement structure was changed to integrate other management system standards, and new concepts such as organizational context and risk based thinking were introduced as added requirements. In this study, the evolution of ISO 9000 standards were discussed and the detail comparisons between ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 9001:2008 were conducted to improve the understandings of the new QMS standard.
