As the activities of SQC (statistical quality control) are based on the analysis of objective quality status and the quantitative approaches to find improvement actions, R can be an efficient software tool. However, using R in SQC activities is not widely spread in the business and education. In this study, we summarized the important packages that can handle SQC methods by package name, maintainer, key activities and functions. We analyzed the limitations of using R in the SQC field and recommended the development of GUI based RcmdrPlugin. Moreover, we suggested RcmdrPlugin development strategy as follows: 1) target for quality control personnel of SME(small and medium enterprise), 2) integrate control charts, process capability, sampling inspection and gage R&R, 3) dual use of RcmdrPlugin and general packages, 4) improve consistency for input and output formats on the related functions.
