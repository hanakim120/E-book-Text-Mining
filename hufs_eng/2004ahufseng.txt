To achieve world-class competitiveness, process improvement initiatives, SPI (Software Process Improvement) and six sigma, have been tried in SI industry. As both of the initiatives are based on TQM (Total Quality Management) principles, they have common perspectives such as continuous process improvement and quantitative analysis for root causes of problems. However, deployment activities for two initiatives are quite different. The SPI model consists of best practices and process improvement is achieved by reducing gaps between current practices and the model. Six sigma provides a series of interventions and statistical tools for process improvement and financial gains. SPI is suitable to develop infrastructure at the initial phase and six sigma is effective to gain financial benefits based on formal process and data collection infrastructure. Thus, it is essential to understand the philosophy and deployment tactics to maximize the synergy effects of two initiatives.
