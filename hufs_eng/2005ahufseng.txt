International recognition and competitiveness of software industries had been significantly improved by successful implementation of SPI(Software process improvement) programs. In this research, empirical investigations were conducted on SPI success factors, levels of SPI activities and organizational performance and an effective strategy on the further deployment of SPI was proposed based on the empirical results. Support of top management was the most important factor of SPI success. The capable SEPG and participation of development personnel were important factors. The achievement of KPAs on level 2 and level 3 was significantly higher than level 4 and 5. In organizational performance, the ability to meet the planned budgets and schedule was not as high as it was expected.
