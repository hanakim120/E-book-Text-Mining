To improve the effectiveness of QM (Quality Management) activities in R&D (Research and Development), we tried to clarify and incorporate the characteristics of R&D. The R&D quality was defined as ¡°the degree to which R&D processes and outputs can fulfill the requirements,¡± and R&D characteristics: project based implementation, variety of R&D project types, importance of strategic alignment and intangible asset management were discussed. Based on the definition and characteristics of R&D, a quality model for R&D was developed. R&D projects were classified by two dimensions: research/development R&D type and specific/fluid requirements, and the R&D QM activities were divided by two dimension: organization/project level and process/output focus.
