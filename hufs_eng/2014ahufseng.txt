There are a few unique characteristics on Research and Development (R&D) projects. Risk for commercial success is high, payback time is long and the forecast of cash flow is uncertain. However, as a project is progressed, relevant information is gathered, uncertainty can be reduced, and decisions for further investment can be made. Stage-Gate process and Option perspective are relevant to these distinct features of R&D projects. In this study, the effectiveness of Stage-Gate process is assessed based on option perspective. If Stage-Gate process is used, the NPV(Net Present Value) becomes higher. Moreover, if uncertainty is higher, the Stage-Gate process becomes more effective.
