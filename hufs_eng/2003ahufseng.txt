Various processes, methodologies, and tools have been developed to improve cycle time, quality and productivity of software development, operation and maintenance. From the late 1980s, the importance of empirical research methods has been emphasized in software engineering field. The empirical methods can provide objective bases for evaluating the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of various techniques. Experiments, surveys, and analyses of observational data are relevant empirical research strategies in software engineering. Among them, experiments can be used to find out causal relationships and establish scientific theories. Activities before experiment execution such as experiment definition and plan, are crucial to the success of experiments. Especially, researchers should pay attention to selection of a relevant experiment design and consideration on various validity threats.
