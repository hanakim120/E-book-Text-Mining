If quality management systems were implemented effectively, high quality of product/service could be achieved with low cost and financial performances and stock prices of an organization could be improved. To investigate the relationships between quality management and organizational competitiveness, a research model was proposed. In this model, quality management activities were divided into infrastructure activities and core activities and organizational performances were divided into operational performances and financial performances. To clarify inconsistent results of previous studies, the independent variables, definitions of quality and quality management were re-evaluated. Three important mechanisms between quality management and organizational competitiveness, relationships between quality and cost and productivity, customer satisfaction and financial performances and high quality organizations and stock prices were investigated.
