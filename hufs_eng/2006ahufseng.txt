There are strong demands on high quality and productivity in software development and maintenance activities. To satisfy these demands, various SPI models based on quality management principles have been developed. SPICE and CMMI became leading standard models for SPI activities. As two models have their own pros and cons, it is desirable to select a suitable model for the environment of organization units. In this paper, conformity of process capability dimension between two models was investigated. In SPICE, there were 2 PAs for each capability levels. However, in CMMI, there were 10 GPs in CMMI level 2 and 2 GPs in level 3. Thus, level 2 of CMMI included some SPICE level 3 GPIs. However, assessment results of two models might be used interchangeably without significant gaps.
