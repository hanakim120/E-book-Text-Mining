To prepare the future of quality professionals, ASQ (American Society for Quality) initiated the future of quality studies from 1996. Seven reports were published every three years. The studies determined and prioritized key forces that would impact the future of quality. In this essay, the key forces were classified into enduring key forces, emerging key forces, and initial key forces based on the trend and frequency. The enduring key forces that appeared from the initial to current studies were globalization, changes driven by technology, and customer focus. The emerging key forces were social responsibility and aging population and the initial key forces were leadership and workforce focus. In 21th century, quality should focus not only on bottom-line but also on top-line. The Quality and innovation should be managed in a harmonized way.
